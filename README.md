# JavaScript interpreter

Implement the `eval` function in src/Eval.hs.

Implement the `evalS` function in src/EvalS.hs.

You may add helper functions, but please do not modify any other code.

Code that does not compile when submitted will receive a grade of 0.

To compile:

        stack build

The first time you build may take a long time as stack has to download other libraries.

To run the `eval` version:

        stack exec jsexp

To run the `evalS` version:

        stack exec jsexpS
